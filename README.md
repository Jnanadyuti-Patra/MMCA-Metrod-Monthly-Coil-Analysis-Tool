# MMCA-Metrod-Monthly-Coil-Analysis-Tool
Metrod Monthly Coil Analysis (MMCA) is a data tracking tool I developed during my internship at Metrod Holdings Berhad, Malaysia. It monitors 48+ process and product parameters in CCR copper rod fabrication to identify and quantify causes behind grade fluctuations, aiding in process optimization and consistency.
